= What is WooCommerce? =
WooCommerce is a free eCommerce plugin that helps you sell anything on your WordPress blog, even affiliate products.

= Installation =
The [Datafeedr WooCommerce Importer Set-up Guide](https://datafeedrapi.helpscoutdocs.com/article/109-datafeedr-woocommerce-importer-set-up-guide?utm_campaign=dfrpswcplugin&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wporg) can be found in our documentation or check out the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4j7bwL9v-E).

= Demo =
[GearGrabber.net](https://www.geargrabber.net/) - We created GearGrabber to demonstrate the power of the Datafeedr WooCommerce Importer plugin. GearGrabber is a marketplace for discounted outdoor gear. GearGrabber is a live site and regularly generates sales.

* **Easy-to-use Interface** - Create an affiliate store in just a few minutes!

* **NO Datafeeds** - No need to download, import and parse large, unorganized CSV or XML files. Datafeedr does all of that for you!

* **Powerful Product Search** - Search across multiple affiliate networks and merchants simultaneously. Filter products by name, description, network, merchant, brand, price, sale price, discount percentage, currency, sale status and more.

* **Saved Searches** - Add products to your store in bulk by saving a search. No need to add products one by one, unless you want to.

* **Store-Specific Merchant Selection** - Select exactly which merchants to promote on a store-by-store basis. No need to search unrelated merchants when you’re creating a niche store. 

* **Automatically Update Products** - Updating doesn't require any action on your part. Product information updates automatically.

* **Automatically Add New Products** - When using "Saved Searches", any new products that match your search will automatically be added to your store during updates. There's no need to continually monitor merchant data feeds for new products.

* **Automatically Remove Old Products** - When a merchant removes a product from their inventory, it will automatically be removed from your store.

* **Updates Run in Background** - Most product importers require you to sit and watch the update until it finishes. Datafeedr performs product updates in the background whether you're watching or not. 

* **Character Encoding** - Properly handles special characters and accents when importing products.

* **Customizable Product Information** - Customize product name, description, and other details before or after loading products into WordPress.

* **Custom Products** - Add products from CSV importers or other sources to your store without conflicting with products imported by the Datafeedr WooCommerce Importer plugin.

* **Custom Categories = Unique Website** - Most product importers use the merchant categories as the product categories on your site. The problem is, your store will be a duplicate of every other site using that merchant’s feed. Our plugin ensures your store will be unique by letting you create the categories you want and add unique groups of products to those categories.

* **SEO** - Works seamlessly with popular SEO plugins such as WordPress SEO, All In One SEO and WooCommerce SEO.

* **Tableless Layout** - Your pages will load faster and be more search engine friendly because no HTML tables are used to display product data.

* **Real Product Pages** - Every product in your store has its own crawlable, indexable URL.

* **Locally Stored Product Images** - All product images are stored on your server allowing them to be resized, optimized, displayed lightning fast, pinned on Pinterest and indexed by Google.

* **Locally Stored Product Data** - All product data is stored in your website's database to ensure it loads fast and is always accessible.

* **Display EAN, UPC & SKU** - Display product codes to attract highly motivated shoppers to your store.

* **NO Javascript Generated Content** - To ensure your product pages are found and indexed by Google, no product data is displayed using JavaScript. 

* **rel="nofollow"** - All affiliate links have the rel="nofollow" attribute added automatically.

* **Masked Affiliate Links** - Prevent leaking PageRank to advertisers by using our WooCommerce Cloak Affiliate Links plugin (free).
