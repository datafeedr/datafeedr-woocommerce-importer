* **Saved Searches** - Add products to your store in bulk by saving a search. No need to add products one by one, unless you want to.

* **Automatically Update Products** - Updating doesn't require any action on your part. Product information updates automatically.

* **Automatically Add New Products** - When using "Saved Searches", any new products that match your search will automatically be added to your store during updates. There's no need to continually monitor merchant data feeds for new products.

* **Automatically Remove Old Products** - When a merchant removes a product from their inventory, it will automatically be removed from your store.

* **Updates Run in Background** - Most product importers require you to sit and watch the update until it finishes. Datafeedr performs product updates in the background whether you're watching or not.
